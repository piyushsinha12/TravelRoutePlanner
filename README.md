# Travel Route Planner (Java, CLI)

A command-line Java application that models real-life cities as a graph and helps users explore routes between them using graph algorithms like **DFS**, **BFS**, and **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Add cities and routes (with distances) dynamically
- Find **all possible paths** between two cities (DFS)
- Find **all shortest-hop paths** (BFS)
- Find the **shortest distance path** (Dijkstra)
- Real-life city names and distances
- Command-line based, simple and intuitive

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithms Used

- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Lists all valid paths
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Finds all shortest paths in terms of hops
- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:** Finds the shortest-distance route
